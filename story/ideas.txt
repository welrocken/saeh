###

- Dialogues are text-based.
- We need a (procedurally generated) map.
- The map has hexagonal tiles.
- In the map there are forests that have goods in them but also dangerous creatures.
- 


- The player plays his character which is the commander of his nation.
- The player controls his nation through some hierarchy, there are heads for every profession.
- The map shows units with their profession types, and also their current work. It will also display their amount.
    For example, to show a fighting crew, it will display their weapon, with a fighting animation.
    Or for a fighter horsemen crew that is lurking around, it will just show a running horse animation.
