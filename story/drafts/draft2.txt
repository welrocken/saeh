Plot

I've finally built company of my dreams. It's small, I'm the team, no one around, but, it's a start.

My company does business now, I had my first customer today. We made a deal for one year. I'm gonna give
them my informational services. Although right now I don't really have that service, but this is business,
so...

I want to buy things, sell things, produce. I want to give services, I want to hire people, I want to build
teams. I want to make this one bigger, I want to acquire more, I want to become the business man, the enrepreneur, 
the dealer, the salesman, whatever you name it. I want to become the hunter. I'm hungry for money, in this
world of money, there is nothing more satisfying than money. I want to be the millionaire, no actually screw
that, I want to be the billionaire, trillionaire if that's a thing.

--- 3rd person abstract

This is a game where you do business. The main purpose seems to be getting your business(es) bigger. You can
choose two different paths (morally). The good one and the bad one, but this is not an actual game choice, 
it's hidden in your consciousness, and only can be telled from your gameplay. If you trick people, the game
rewards you minorly in the short term. But eventually, in the long term, doing the "right" things (morally),
will make your business better. The gameplay includes actions like hiring people, selling things, making deals 
(long term, short term), giving services. Basically you are running a business as in real life. You can also
acquire other goods (such as houses, gold, other companies etc.), so there's investment too.
