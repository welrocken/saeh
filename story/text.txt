Plot Summary

- You are a leader trying to survive in a brutal world. [Just to survive might not be a good enough motivation.]
- There is no main quest other than to survive. [There can be a main quest but it can also be ignorable]
- You have to build an army and feed them.
- Your actions will make you a barbarian or a lord. (mesela :D)
- If you can not feed them they will turn against you.
- The choices you are going to make will affect your reputation.
- You can acquire people by looting a village (of some sort) or find one idle person


You will start with some recources and a small crew.
